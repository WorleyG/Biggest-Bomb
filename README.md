# What Made What

A Web game for guessing and matching movies to their profit
HTML - CSS - JavaScript - jQuery - TMDB API

This app uses the JavaScript version of the TMDB API by Cavestri to search for an actor, and then presents 3 current movies they were in. The user then will try to match the profit to the movie, and score a point if they are correct.
